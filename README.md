## Enhancing solar panel efficiency through Computer Vision-Based Dust Detection 
## Introduction
Solar energy is a clean and sustainable power source, but its efficiency is often reduced due to dust accumulation on solar panels.
This project addresses the challenge of dust detection to maintain optimal solar panel performance.
Objective: Enhance solar panel efficiency using computer vision techniques to detect and quantify dust.
